# What is blockchain?

> "Understanding blockchains is kind of difficult (personally, I’m still far away from understanding everything about it), but I consider understanding Git internals as a good way to understand merkle trees which definitely helps understanding a fundamental part about blockchains." - (poke, 305,575 rep on StackOverflow, https://stackoverflow.com/a/46195087/229341)


"The blockchain is a decentralized technology that allows users to exchange transactions (e.g., digital assets). Technically, it is a distributed ledger replicated over a network of peers where each peer locally stocks a copy of the ledger. Data on that ledger can be readable and writable by everyone, but it is stored in such a way that modifying the committed transactions’ history is hard from a computational point of view. Therefore, the blockchain is created in such a way that past data cannot be altered nor removed. As its name suggests, “blockchain” stands for chain of blocks because every block that contains a subset of the entire records’ list, is linked to the next one forming a chain." -

# How do I get into blockchain development?

The tech stack for blockchain is very broad. And depends on what later of the stack/ecosystem are you working upon. For ex: if you choose to build on Ethereum, then you will need to

- build the smart contracts in a language called Solidity
- write test cases in either solidity or Javascript
- create your distributed app (dApp) in Javascript.
- develop the ethereum blockchain itself it will be in go lang.

Similarly if you choose to build on Solana you will

- need to build your programs (equivalent of ethereum smart contracts) in either rust or c. They may add more language later
- write your test cases in rust, c, or javascript
- write your dApp in Javascript and
- develop the blockchain itself on rust.

And similarly there are other chains with their own language. For ex Ziliqa has its own language.

here are many choices available and depending on the current state of ecosystem; if you want to be a dApp developer one must be having solidity, Javascript a must (because ethereum is de facto choice at the moment). Solana is picking up so rust is also a good choice. However if you want to be a blockchain developer go and rust are your choices.
