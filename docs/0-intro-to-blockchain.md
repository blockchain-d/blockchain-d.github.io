# What is blockchain?

> "Understanding blockchains is kind of difficult (personally, I’m still far away from understanding everything about it), but I consider understanding Git internals as a good way to understand merkle trees which definitely helps understanding a fundamental part about blockchains." - (poke, 305,575 rep on StackOverflow, https://stackoverflow.com/a/46195087/229341)


"The blockchain is a decentralized technology that allows users to exchange transactions (e.g., digital assets). Technically, it is a distributed ledger replicated over a network of peers where each peer locally stocks a copy of the ledger. Data on that ledger can be readable and writable by everyone, but it is stored in such a way that modifying the committed transactions’ history is hard from a computational point of view. Therefore, the blockchain is created in such a way that past data cannot be altered nor removed. As its name suggests, “blockchain” stands for chain of blocks because every block that contains a subset of the entire records’ list, is linked to the next one forming a chain." -
